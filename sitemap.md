# Planning

## Sitemap

### Main page

- This is the main hub where we will have links to different parts of the page.
- Here, it will be mostly empty except for maybe a picture with clearly visible links for those interested to click through.
- Each links will be as follows:

#### About

- This is the only page with multiple sub-menus.
- Each sub-menu will be different aspects of my academic career such as:

1. Education
2. Employment & Awards (both institutional awards & fellowships)
3. Writing (both books and articles)
4. Talks (such as conference presentations, with videos if possible)

#### Updates

- While not entirely like a more casual nature of Ruin's page where blogging is mixed with updates on her project, this page will provide a ways for me to update those who are interested in where I am in various projects.
- I will still emulate Ruin's repository of casual text posts as the format, where one can click through each posts, rather than having to update the whole page every time I make an update.

#### Contact

- This will be a simple list of where one might find me
  - such as academia.edu,
  - institutional email
  - and a form to contact me through the site

## Goals of the site & Reasoning

- The website that would be the most useful to me is a place where I can easily announce progress on my projects, have a basic overview of my education and experience (essentially, a CV), and have a list of ways for those trying to reach out to me to contact me.
  - In a lot of ways, Susan Stryker's website is a good skeleton to look at, for this reason (though I am nowhere near competent enough in webpage development for my website to look as clean).
  - Yet, Ruin's website with a stream of consciousness that allows for her to communicate to her readers humanizes the otherwise reclusive scholar, and helps the readers understand where she is in her projects. So I decided to adopt this as a part of my website.
- When it comes to webpage design, I am a firm believer of Less is More. The less the visitors have to click through, the better. Even if it does mean that they have to go back to the main menu, this would be better than needing to remember where in the labyrinthian submenus that the visitor have to navigate to in order to find the information that they need.
