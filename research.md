## Susan Stryker's website (<https://www.susanstryker.net/>)

### Pros - Stryker

- Very simple design, very easy to navigate
- No personal detaiil outside of CV details
- Easy to contact Stryker via a built-in form
- All self-hosted, not reliant on proprietary services
  - that we can immediately tell

### Cons - Stryker

- Might be too simple to some: could feel unfinished
- Very corporate in feel
  - Less like an academic's site and more like a public speaker seeking new clients
- She mitigates some of this by offering links to her social media, where there's different focuss on topic to be presented.
  
## Ruin's website (<https://runtoruin.com/>)

### Pros - Ruin

- Also very easy to navigate, even if there's a lot more posts, thanks to extensive tagging of posts
- Not a lot of sub-sections on the websites, doesn't overwhelm the visitors
- None of the files are self-hosted (website hosted by wordpress, files hosted by google drive), leading to no hosting cost for Ruin
- Very interpersonal atmosphere to the site, very different from corporate feel of Stryker's site
  - There isn't even a form to contact Ruin, just her email
  - Lot of personal updates, such as how her health is doing, of which there is 0 in Stryker's website.

### Cons - Ruin

- Relies on proprietary client
  - Ruin had previously used a Korean client, now uses Wordpress
  - Website's longievity relies on the service's longievity
  - Limited to the limitations of the client (such as needing to keep to Wordpress's formatting)
- More personal updates can tend to seem unprofessional
- The migration has changed the url structure, leading to a ton of dead links
